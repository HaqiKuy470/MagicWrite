# MagicWrite
how to use it:
    allow camera access
    hold the SHIFT key on your keyboard to start drawing ink (this is the trick to make it look clean without the ink dragging everywhere)
    let go of shift to move your hand to the next letter
    hit the spacebar if u mess up and want to clear the screen
feel free to mess around with the colors or the smoothing math.
