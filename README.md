# MagicWrite
how to use it: <br>
    1. allow camera access <br>
    2. hold the SHIFT key on your keyboard to start drawing ink (this is the trick to make it look clean without the ink dragging everywhere) <br>
    3. let go of shift to move your hand to the next letter <br>
    4. hit the spacebar if u mess up and want to clear the screen <br>
feel free to mess around with the colors or the smoothing math. <br>
